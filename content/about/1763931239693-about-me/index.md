Hi, I’m Andrea, a computer engineer from Northern Italy. I graduated in March 2024 and currently work as a service engineer for a company developing grid-scale energy storage solutions. I have previously worked as an electrotechnical designer for logistics automation, gaining solid experience in electrotechnical design. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with programming and electronics.
