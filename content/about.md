Hi! im Andrea Cerfoglia, a 22yo currently studying computer engineering at [Politecnico Di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) in Milan, Italy.

at the time of this writing I'm in my (hopefully) last year of study and closer than ever to my bachelor degree. 

I hope to use this blog as a portfolio of my project and ideas as sometimes i create clever things and I would  like being able to share them with other thinkers and pheraps even show off too!

in this blog I'll mainly talk about my various passions spacing from electronics to woodworking, touching a bit of this and a bit of that (do you know that I restored my very own vespa?)

follow me through my jurney!
